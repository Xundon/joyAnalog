### A STM32 dev board with 10 high speed 12-bit DAC channels.

I intend to use it for automating game console controller inputs, but it can be used as a general purpose dev board as well. 

* STM32F072R8T6 microcontroller. 64KB flash, 16KB RAM
* MAX5723/MAX5724/MAX5725 8 channel high speed SPI DAC + 2 channel STM32 built-in DAC
* 36 GPIOs broken out on headers, as well as BOOT0, RESET, VBAT, and SWD pins
* USB for power and communication
* board size 4.3 x 4.3 cm, or 1.69 x 1.69 inch

This is still in progress. I need to get the PCB made, assemble it, and write the firmware. More to come in the following weeks.

The "switchmod" name is pretty much a place holder, will probably change it if a better one pops into my head.
