### A STM32 development board with 10 high-speed 12-bit DAC channels.

I intend to use it for automating game console controller inputs, but it can also be used as a general purpose dev board. 

* STM32F072R8T6 microcontroller, 64KB flash, 16KB RAM.
* MAX5723/MAX5724/MAX5725 8-channel high-speed SPI DAC + 2-channel built-in DAC.
* 36 GPIOs(or 40 using internal oscillators), BOOT0, RESET, VBAT, and SWD on headers.
* USB for power and communication.
* Board size 4.3 x 4.3 cm, or 1.69 x 1.69 inch.
